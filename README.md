# Embed an Office Group conversation into SharePoint Online

A SharePoint html page sends an Ajax request to the Office 365 Unified API and get the data of the Office Group.
This is possible thanks to a JavaScript Web Application using CORS to access Office 365 APIs. 

For doing this, You need 
<ul>
<li>an Office 365 environement</li>
<li>a global admin access to this environement</li>
<li>a Microsot Azure subscription</li>
</ul>
